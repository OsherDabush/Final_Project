This project represents the culmination of my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. 
It involves the development of a real-time hand gesture recognition system implemented on an FPGA. 
The system is designed to process and analyze hand gestures using FPGA hardware, enabling rapid and efficient gesture recognition. 
This project showcases my ability to apply advanced digital design techniques and real-time processing on FPGA platforms.
